      <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />Are you - Nobody - Too?<br />Then there's
        a pair of us!<br />Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />How public - like a Frog -<br />To
        tell one's name - the livelong June -<br />To an admiring Bog!
      </p>
